# data

The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for several datasets that GeoNet hosts. These are generally updated on an infrequent or irregular basis. This repository provides easy access to the data, versioning and allows the owners/curators of the data to update files when needed.

Each folder is a self contained dataset, which includes:
 - a readme file with a description of the data
 - the files that contain the data
 - some tests that provide some sanity checks on the data
 
## Datasets currently in this repository
 
| Dataset Name  | Description   |

| [Rupture Models](rupture-models) | Seismic and geodetic fault models for significant earthquakes |

Note: The GeoNet website refers to the master branch for downloading this data through the website. Everything is the master branch requires review. Other branches might have more up to date information that is awaiting review and merging with master.
