# data

The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for several datasets that GeoNet hosts. These are generally updated on an infrequent or irregular basis. This repository provides easy access to the data, versioning and allows the owners/curators of the data to update files when needed.

Each folder is a self contained dataset, which includes:
 - a readme file with a description of the data
 - the files that contain the data
 - some tests that provide some sanity checks on the data (optional)
 
## Datasets currently in this repository
 
| Dataset Name  | Description   |
