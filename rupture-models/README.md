# GNS Science Aotearoa New Zealand Earthquake Rupture Models 

The GNS Aotearoa New Zealand Earthquake Rupture Models dataset is a collection of rupture models for regional events. Currently, this repository contains 18 rupture models from 14 events.

A rupture model comprises a spatiotemporal description of the rupture process during an earthquake, as inferred from source inversion of either seismic recordings, geodetic measurements, or both. These models were provided by seismologists (authors) from GNS and other institutes worldwide. 

This repository is organized into directories (or folders) and sub-directories (or subfolders). The adopted structure puts the specific files according to events, authors of the rupture models, and multiple rupture models for the same event.

The following lists the earthquakes.

### File Formats

Each file for a rupture model will necessarily have the following:
- Slip (preferably in m or cm).
- Geographical coordinates: Latitude (in degrees), Longitude (in degrees),and Depth (in km) for the slip patches (or sub-faults).

More complete data for the rupture model will include:
- Rise time,  i.e.,  the slip duration at each point on the rupture plane)
- Rupture onset time (or simply, rupture time), i.e.,  the relative time when slip is initiated at a point on the rupture plane.
- In case of multi-window inversions, slip information for each time window.

The file formats curently available include CSV, FSP, and MAT.
- CSV format lists the rupture parameters in a comma-separated tabulated format.
- FSP (or Finite Source Parameters).
- MAT (which is Matlab structure format).

FSP and MAT are standard formats used in the SRCMOD database - a global repository of earthquake source models. More details can be found on the equake-rc site: 
[SRCMOD File Formats](http://equake-rc.info/SRCMOD/fileformats/).

Meta data for each model can be found in the FSP file and is also provided in separate (model.meta) file. The metadata for a rupture model can include:
- Specific region, and Date (Month, Day, and Year) of the event.
- Magnitude (in Mw scale) and seismic moment (in Nm).
- Epicentral location (latitude and longitude in degrees).
- Hypocentral depth (in km).
- Focal mechanism with strike, dip, and rake angles in degrees.
- A very short description of the data used in the inversion.
- Inversion specific settings such as source time function, number and length of time windows, crustal structure, and spatial gridding.
- Number of fault segments or faults.
- Data sources such as external websites, supplementary to a published article, emailed by the authors, etc.
- Wherever information is not available, the entries are made to indicate that to the users (e.g., using ‘NaN’).
- Citation and reference.

The metadata file is written in the [TOML format](https://toml.io/en/).
