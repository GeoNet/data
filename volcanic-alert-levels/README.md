# Volcanic ALert Levels

New Zealand uses a [Volcanic Alert Level](https://www.geonet.org.nz/about/volcano/val) (VAL) system to define the current status of each volcano. The alert levels range from 0 to 5. The alert levels are used to guide any appropriate response.

A changes in VAL is decided by a Volcano Monitoring Group at GNS Science, and is publicised using a [Volcanic Alert Bulletin}(https://www.geonet.org.nz/volcano/vab/) (VAB)
