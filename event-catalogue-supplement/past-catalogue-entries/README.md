# Past-catalogue-entries supplement
This dataset is a record of some past entries of the CUSP earthquake catalogue database inactive since 2013. 

## Event Dataset description
This dataset is an event listing classified as "other" without any magnitudes associated. The numerous events are located worldwide and poorly informed and not compatible to our current information systems. Hence they are excluded from our present catalogues but listing and short summary can be found here instead. The original seiscomp xml dataset is available on-demand.

Only Events with _No magnitude information and fromtype "other"_ are listed here. 

The Past "other" events dataset is covering years from 1942 to 2011. It has about 28000 entries which locations are spread wordlwide. The data set consists of a listing in a '.csv' format.
