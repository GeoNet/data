## DART Auto-Trigger Catalogue

A Catalogue of automatic triggers detected by the DART Network. These triggers have been classified by a specialist at GNS Science into different categories as listed below and are sorted by station and UTC date-time. The triggers were classified and reviewed by a panel when the trigger classification was difficult. 

For plotting these signals, [Tilde Data Discovery](https://tilde.geonet.org.nz/ui/data-exploration#/) is a good tool. To use it, you will need to specify the DART and change the time period to the date shown by the triggered time. Data Discovery can also be used to download the data in JSON and CSV formats. If you would prefer an API please use [Tilde API](https://tilde.geonet.org.nz/v3/api-docs/).

For more information on the DART Network, please refer to the [GeoNet DART](https://www.geonet.org.nz/tsunami/dart) page.

For information on the PMEL Tsunami detection algorithm used by the DARTs, please refer to the documentation on the NOAA website, [found here](https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/tda_documentation.html).

This catalogue is updated regularly and was last updated on the 4th February 2025. 

| Category | Name | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| O | Offset | A sudden change in pressure that then becomes the new normal. |
| SP | Positive Spike | A positive spike with an unknown cause. Some of these could be single data points and numerical errors. |
| SN | Negative Spike | A negative spike with an unknown cause. Some of these could be single data points and numerical errors. |
| MS | Multiple Spikes | Common for NZA, includes multiple spikes / shark teeth patterns. |
| E | Earthquake | Contains an earthquake signal and can be related to an earthquake detection by the seismic network. |
| T | Tsunami | A tsunami event. |
| U | Unclassified | An unclassified event. |
